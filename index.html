                <h3>Introduction to Platform Security</h3>
                <p>Platform Security is a comprehensive approach to safeguarding computing
                    platforms—including hardware, operating systems, software applications,
                    and data—from internal and external threats. It plays a vital role in
                    ensuring that systems remain secure, reliable, and functional while
                    maintaining the trust of users and organizations. The lesson emphasizes
                    the importance of securing all layers of a platform: physical security
                    protects hardware from theft or tampering; firmware and boot security
                    prevent unauthorized system startups; operating system security enforces
                    updates and access control; application security guards against malicious 
                    code; network security uses firewalls and VPNs to protect data in transit; 
                    and data security employs encryption to keep sensitive information safe.</p>
                
                <p>The CIA Triad—Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability—serves as the core 
                    foundation of information security. Confidentiality ensures that private data
                    is accessed only by authorized individuals, integrity guarantees that information
                    remains accurate and unaltered, and availability ensures that authorized users can
                    access systems and data when needed. To strengthen these principles, authentication
                    methods such as passwords, tokens, and biometrics verify user identities, while multi-factor
                    authentication (MFA) adds an extra layer of protection. The lesson also covers non-repudiation,
                    which ensures accountability by preventing users from denying their actions, and privacy, which
                    protects individuals’ personal data in compliance with laws such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).</p>
                
                <p>Furthermore, the lesson discusses Information Security Risk Management, a structured process that involves
                    identifying valuable assets, recognizing vulnerabilities, and analyzing threats that could exploit them.
                    Threat actors can include insiders, hackers, competitors, or automated bots. Once risks are assessed, organizations
                    apply treatment strategies such as avoidance (eliminating the risk), mitigation (reducing the impact), acceptance
                    (acknowledging the risk), or transference (shifting it to another party, like insurance).</p>
                
                <p>In summary, platform security integrates technological measures, organizational policies,
                    and human awareness to create a multi-layered defense against cyberattacks. By applying the CIA Triad,
                    enforcing authentication, ensuring privacy, and managing risks effectively, organizations can maintain
                    the stability, confidentiality, and resilience of their information systems in an increasingly digital world.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="box">
                <h3>Security Awareness Training</h3>
                <p>The Security Awareness Training lesson focuses on the vital role humans play in cybersecurity.
                    It explains that people are often the weakest link in an organization’s defense, as even advanced
                    security tools cannot prevent errors caused by carelessness or lack of awareness. The lesson cites
                    the PhilHealth Medusa attack as an example of how data breaches can lead to serious consequences such
                    as identity theft, fraud, and claim issues. It reminds individuals that everyone is a potential target
                    because attackers seek access to company systems through weak passwords, reused credentials, and unsecured personal devices.</p>
                
                <p>A major topic discussed is phishing attacks, one of the most common forms of cybercrime. Phishing can occur 
                    through emails (email phishing), text messages (smishing), phone calls (vishing), and fake websites that 
                    trick users into revealing personal or financial information. The lesson teaches how to identify phishing 
                    attempts by recognizing warning signs such as unknown senders, unrealistic promises, poor grammar, suspicious 
                    links, and messages with a sense of urgency. To protect themselves, individuals are encouraged to verify the sender’s 
                    identity, avoid clicking on unfamiliar links, never share personal information, and use official websites instead of 
                    links provided in messages.</p>
                
                <p>The lesson also covers malware, software created by cybercriminals to harm or exploit devices and networks. It lists 
                    indicators of infection such as slow performance, frequent pop-ups, and device overheating. Other threats include 
                    business email compromise, where hackers impersonate trusted contacts to steal money or data, and insider threats, 
                    where employees misuse their access to systems for revenge or personal gain. To counter these risks, the training 
                    advises enabling two-factor authentication (2FA), avoiding suspicious downloads, and verifying unusual requests 
                    through alternative communication channels.</p>
                
                <p>Lastly, the lesson provides essential cyber hygiene practices to enhance online safety. These include performing 
                    regular data backups to recover from attacks, keeping software and systems up to date to patch vulnerabilities, 
                    and using strong, unique passphrases instead of simple passwords. It also promotes the use of password managers 
                    for secure storage. The lesson concludes by emphasizing that data is the new gold, meaning that personal and 
                    organizational information holds immense value. Therefore, everyone must take responsibility for protecting 
                    their data and maintaining privacy to ensure a safer and more secure digital environment.</p>

            <div class="box">
                <h3>Platform Architecture</h3>
                <p>The Platform Architecture lesson explains the structure and layers of a computing platform, which include 
                    hardware, firmware, operating systems, and applications. Hardware consists of physical components such as the CPU, 
                    memory, and storage, while firmware like BIOS or UEFI initializes the hardware before the system starts. The operating 
                    system (OS) manages hardware resources and enforces security, and applications provide user-level services. The lesson 
                    also compares mobile and desktop platforms, noting that mobile platforms focus on portability, battery efficiency, and 
                    app sandboxing, while desktops offer higher performance and flexibility but have a larger attack surface. Additionally, 
                    it discusses cloud and virtualization platforms, which increase resource efficiency but introduce new risks such as 
                    misconfigurations and VM escape attacks.</p>
                
                <p>A key topic in the lesson is the Trusted Platform Module (TPM), a hardware-based security chip that acts as the Root 
                    of Trust in a computing platform. TPM operates independently from the main CPU and provides secure storage, encryption, 
                    and attestation. It ensures secure booting by verifying that the system has not been tampered with before starting the 
                    operating system, protecting against firmware and boot-level malware. The lesson also introduces UEFI, the modern replacement 
                    for BIOS, which serves as a bridge between hardware and the OS. Together with TPM, it supports the Chain of Trust, where each 
                    stage of the boot process verifies the integrity of the next stage. The lesson also differentiates TPM 1.2 and TPM 2.0, 
                    highlighting that TPM 2.0 offers stronger cryptographic algorithms and is required for modern systems such as Windows 11.</p>
                
                <p>The lesson then explores Virtualization, a technology that allows multiple virtual machines (VMs) to run simultaneously 
                    on one physical server. Each VM operates independently with its own OS and applications, optimizing hardware utilization 
                    and reducing costs. There are several types of virtualization, including server, desktop, network, storage, and application 
                    virtualization. Virtualization relies on hypervisors, which manage resources between virtual machines. Type 1 (bare-metal) 
                    hypervisors run directly on hardware and offer better performance, while Type 2 (hosted) hypervisors run on top of a host OS. 
                    Despite its advantages—like cost efficiency, agility, and improved disaster recovery—virtualization also brings risks such as 
                    hyperjacking, VM escape, and misconfiguration vulnerabilities, which can compromise entire systems if not managed properly.</p>
                
                <p>To maintain secure virtualization environments, the lesson recommends several best practices. Administrators should keep 
                    hypervisors updated, enforce strict access controls with multi-factor authentication (MFA), and follow recognized security 
                    baselines such as CIS or NIST standards. It’s also important to monitor VM behavior, control network traffic using virtual 
                    switches and VLAN segmentation, and encrypt VM images and storage. Techniques like VM isolation, resource allocation controls, 
                    and snapshot encryption further strengthen system security. Overall, the Platform Architecture lesson emphasizes that combining 
                    trusted hardware components like TPM with secure virtualization practices builds a stronger, more reliable, and well-protected computing environment.</p>
